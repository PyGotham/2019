      <h1>Code of Conduct Transparency Report</h1>
    

    



<p>PyGotham strives to be a friendly and welcoming environment, and we take our
code of conduct seriously. In the spirit of transparency, we publish a summary
of the reports we received this year.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We appreciate those reports, and we encourage anyone who witnesses a code of
conduct violation to report it via the methods listed at
<a href="https://2019.pygotham.org/about/code-of-conduct/">https://2019.pygotham.org/about/code-of-conduct/</a>. PyGotham 2019 had four
code of conduct reports made to the organizers. Anonymized details of these
reports are below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>During the public voting phase of PyGotham’s talk selection process, a voter used the code of
conduct report form to report an issue unrelated to the code of conduct. Conference staff
confirmed that this was not a code of conduct incident with the reporter, and no further action
was taken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the public voting phase of PyGotham’s talk selection process, a report was made regarding
possible usage rights in a data collection process covered by the proposed talk. Copyright and /
or terms of service violations are out of scope for PyGotham’s code of conduct. No further action
was taken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attendee made a joke about a turtle with no legs. Another attendee approached them to let them
know that they should not have made the joke and should apologize. The first attendee reported
themself and apologized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Code of Conduct committee received a report that a vendor had violated a professional code of
conduct. Conference staff agreed that this did not violate PyGotham’s code of conduct, and
communicated this with the reporter. No further action was taken.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
