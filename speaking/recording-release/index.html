      <h1>Recording Release</h1>
    

    <p>Part of the motivation for  is to help with Python
education and advocacy in New York City. Accordingly, we intend to record all PyGotham 2019 presentations and release the recordings on the web (see
<a href="https://pyvideo.org">https://pyvideo.org</a>).</p>

<p>By submitting your talk or tutorial proposal, or by signing up to give a
lightning talk, you agree to give permission to Big Apple Py to record, edit,
and release audio and/or video of your presentation.</p>

<p>By default, the recording release checkbox is checked. If you wish to opt-out, uncheck the
release checkbox, note that while a recording of your talk will be made, it will
be destroyed during post production. You cannot opt out of the release for
lightning talks.</p>

<p>You agree to the following legalese, which certifies that you are the author of
your presentation (or otherwise allowed to present it at
PyGotham 2019), and which allows Big Apple Py 1) to perform the
necessary audio and video editing needed to prepare your presentation, and 2) to
distribute the recordings to other people, including on YouTube, or video sites.
It also allows other people to watch the recordings.</p>

<p>Legalese:</p>
