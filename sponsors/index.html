      <p>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python
programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international
community of Python programmers. The majority of the PSF’s work is focused on empowering and
supporting people within the Python community. The PSF has active grant programs that support
sprints, conferences, meet ups, user groups, and Python development efforts all over the world. In
addition, the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference. Being part
of the PSF means being part of the Python community. Recently we changed the PSF to an open
membership organization, so that everyone who uses and supports Python can join. To learn more,
